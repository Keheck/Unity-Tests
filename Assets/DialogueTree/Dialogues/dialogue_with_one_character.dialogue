[Character1]
[Happy]
Oh, hey there! This is a basic dialogue with just one character.
With a new line you can determine the next dialogue text.
When there are a lot of characters, the text boc immediately wraps around.

[Sad]
You can also change the emotion on the fly...
[Neutral]
...by using [emotion] on a single line

Empty lines will be omited. Makes it easier for the developer.
